# Overview
Hello and welcome! :smile:

We would like to know more about your technical skills but don't worry this is a simple challenge!

We will review it in general about how do you code, how it was written and what choices you took to finish the project. Although we are not requiring any specific layout design, we are looking forward to see how it will look like.

We ask you to finish the project within one week after you got this challenge but if you need more time just let us know.

Let's go!

## How to start

1. Fork this repository https://github.com/saraahso/frontend-challenge-2022
2. Create a new Next.js project

## Challenge

We want you to create a blog page. Consume the provided API(link below) and show a list of posts displaying the `title` and `body` data you received from it.

For every 3 posts you display, please include a Call-to-Action banner. You can style it the way you prefer but if you need a wireframe for reference here it goes:

You are free to decide how the project will look.
